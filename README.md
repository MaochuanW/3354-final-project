# 5541-final-project

For this project, I worked with census data of Hawaii and other GIS data to make an interactive map that shows the distribution of housing value and demographic income data in relation to the proximity of volcanoes on the big island in Hawaii. This juypter notebook consists of using various python packages to add interactivity to my final project. In addition, there are maps that uses census block data along with interactivity functions to let people explore census data.
